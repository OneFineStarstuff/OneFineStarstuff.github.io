AGI Pipeline

Overview

The AGI (Artificial General Intelligence) Pipeline is a comprehensive and modular software framework designed to integrate various AI capabilities, including Natural Language Processing (NLP), Computer Vision (CV), Multi-Modal Processing, Reinforcement Learning (RL), and Real-Time Video Processing. This pipeline leverages state-of-the-art models and techniques to provide a robust and scalable solution for diverse AI tasks.

Features

- Natural Language Processing (NLP): Utilizes the BART model for text summarization and other NLP tasks.
- Computer Vision (CV): Employs the ResNet50 model for image classification and advanced data augmentation techniques.
- Multi-Modal Processing: Integrates the CLIP model to process and understand text and image inputs simultaneously.
- Reinforcement Learning (RL): Implements the PPO algorithm for training RL agents with a custom environment.
- Real-Time Video Processing: Supports real-time video processing using OpenCV.
- Voice and Speech Integration: Incorporates speech-to-text and text-to-speech capabilities.
- Interactive Visualization: Utilizes Plotly for dynamic and interactive data visualization.
- Deployment and Scalability: Designed for easy deployment to cloud platforms such as AWS, GCP, and Heroku.
- Comprehensive Testing and Validation: Implements unit tests and integration tests using PyTest.
- User Interface: Provides a web-based user interface using Flask and React.

Installation

Prerequisites

- Python 3.8 or higher
- Docker (for containerization)
- Git (for version control)

Clone the Repository

```bash
git clone https://github.com/your-username/AGI-Pipeline.git
cd AGI-Pipeline
```

Install Dependencies

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
```

Running the Application

Using Docker

1. Build the Docker Image:

```bash
docker build -t agi-pipeline .
```

2. Run the Docker Image:

```bash
docker run -p 8000:8000 agi-pipeline
```

Without Docker

```bash
uvicorn app:app --host 0.0.0.0 --port 8000
```

Usage

API Endpoints

- /process/: Processes text and video inputs for multi-modal integration.
- /nlp/: Processes text for summarization.
- /cv/: Processes images for classification.
- /real-time-video/: Starts real-time video processing.
- /speech-to-text/: Converts speech to text.
- /text-to-speech/: Converts text to speech.
- /secure-endpoint/: A secure endpoint demonstrating token-based authentication.

Example Requests

Text Summarization

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/nlp/" -H "Content-Type: application/json" -d '{"text": "Summarize this text."}'
```

Image Classification

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/cv/" -F "image=@path_to_image.jpg"
```

Multi-Modal Processing

```bash
curl -X POST "http://localhost:8000/process/" -F "text=Describe this image" -F "video=@path_to_video.mp4"
```
